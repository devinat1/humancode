# HumanCode

The AI coding agent that writes code with you, not for you.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g humancode
brew install humancode
```

## Usage

```bash
humancode
```

## Debug Mode

HumanCode includes a debug agent that writes code one step at a time and walks you through each step with the VS Code debugger. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through execution to understand exactly what changed and why. Switch to it with `Tab`.

Requires VS Code or Cursor to be open with the [Agentic Debugger](https://open-vsx.org/extension/devinat1/agentic-debugger) extension installed.
